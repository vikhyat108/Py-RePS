# Py-RePS  
***********************************  
                ********* Py-Reps - v. Feb 2025 *********  
***********************************
  
Py-RePS is a python equivalent of RePS code(https://github.com/matteozennaro/reps)  
Latest version on https://github.com/vikhyat108/Py-RePS  

## Dependencies  
- Python package for CLASS i.e. "classy v3.2.1" (Can be installed using "pip install classy")  
- scipy 1.10.0  
- numpy 1.24.1  

*****************************************

This repository contains two folders, `1-Fluid` and `2-Fluid`, which correspond to two different cosmological models:

1. **1-Fluid (Only CDM)**: A cosmology with total matter density consisting only of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles.
2. **2-Fluid (Massive Neutrinos + CDM)**: A cosmology that includes both CDM and massive neutrino particles.

## 1-Fluid (Only CDM)
The `1-Fluid` folder contains a Python script that generates the rescaled:
- Growth rates
- Transfer functions
- Power spectrum P(k)

These serve as the initial conditions for N-body simulations. Additionally, a parameter file allows users to modify cosmological parameters for their model.

**Note:** The `FF_GG` folder is not used in the 1-Fluid model; it is included for consistency purposes only.

## 2-Fluid (Massive Neutrinos + CDM Cosmology)
The `2-Fluid` folder also contains a Python script that performs the same tasks as in the `1-Fluid` model, generating:
- Growth rates
- Transfer functions
- Power spectrum P(k)

Users can modify the cosmology using the provided parameter file.

The `FF_GG` folder is used in this case to compute an integral required for the 2-Fluid model. The scripts for generating this file are inside the folder. However, users do not need to regenerate this file repeatedlyâ€”it can be generated once and used indefinitely, as it does not need to be updated for different cosmological models.

## Running the Code
If you have installed "classy v3.2.1" then you can directly use the following command:

```sh
python3 py-reps_1F.py  ####  For 1-Fluid case

python3 py-reps_2F.py  ####  For 2-Fluid case
```
  
  
Otherwise if you are having trouble with classy, you can choose to run CLASS(https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public version---2.10) code manually, for doing this do the following:-  
 - Copy CLASS code's folder inside the Py-RePS folder, where you have 1-Fluid and 2-Fluid folders (alternatively you can specify the path to your CLASS folder inside the py-reps_1F_class.py and py-reps_2F_class.py files respectively).
 - Rename the CLASS code's folder as "CLASS".
 - Now make two folders named "output_1F" and "output_2F" inside CLASS folder.  
 - Finally, copy the files named "parameters_1F_class.ini" and "parameters_2F_class.ini" from 1-Fluid and 2-Fluid folders respectively to the CLASS folder.

After doing this now run the command:

```sh
python3 py-reps_1F_class.py  ####  For 1-Fluid case

python3 py-reps_2F_class.py  ####  For 2-Fluid case

```
 



After execution, the output files will be saved in the `1F_ICs` and `2F_ICs` folders respectively.

For further modifications and parameter adjustments, refer to the parameter file within each respective folder.
