Py-RePS is a python equivalent of RePS code(https://github.com/matteozennaro/reps)  
Latest version on https://github.com/vikhyat108/Py-RePS  


This repository contains two folders, `1-Fluid` and `2-Fluid`, which correspond to two different cosmological models:

1. **1-Fluid (Only CDM)**: A cosmology with total matter density consisting only of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles.
2. **2-Fluid (Massive Neutrinos + CDM)**: A cosmology that includes both CDM and massive neutrino particles.

## 1-Fluid (Only CDM)
The `1-Fluid` folder contains a Python script that generates the rescaled:
- Growth rates
- Transfer functions
- Power spectrum P(k)

These serve as the initial conditions for N-body simulations. Additionally, a parameter file allows users to modify cosmological parameters for their model.

**Note:** The `FF_GG` folder is not used in the 1-Fluid model; it is included for consistency purposes only.

## 2-Fluid (Massive Neutrinos + CDM Cosmology)
The `2-Fluid` folder also contains a Python script that performs the same tasks as in the `1-Fluid` model, generating:
- Growth rates
- Transfer functions
- Power spectrum P(k)

Users can modify the cosmology using the provided parameter file.

The `FF_GG` folder is used in this case to compute an integral required for the 2-Fluid model. The scripts for generating this file are inside the folder. However, users do not need to regenerate this file repeatedlyâ€”it can be generated once and used indefinitely, as it does not need to be updated for different cosmological models.

## Running the Code
To execute the script, use the following command:

```sh
python3 py-reps_1F.py
```

After execution, the output files will be saved in the `1F_ICs` folder.

For further modifications and parameter adjustments, refer to the parameter file within each respective folder.
